# the-world
 This is a simple React App that uses `restcountries API` to list all the countries of **The World** .
 [The World]((https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5gTP7CX8CLw/Xbq3ilYsOTI/AAAAAAAAF1c/A_54ax2J3p8uZP2KmDnITHsR2YLTExQigCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/World_map_black.PNG))

## Key Points :
+ It uses card-based display to show all countries with their flag , alongwith capital and currency in the Home page .
+ When clicked on a specific country card , it directs to that specific country page , in which all details of the country can be presented.
+ Filters like filter by *Name* and *Continent* are available

## Expected Improvements :
+ Improvement in the UI
+ More Descriptive and good-looking UI page for *Country Details* page.
+ Uniform size of each card in Home page(Use ellipsis or any other feature.)

The Documentation for the used `restcountries API` can be [found here](https://restcountries.com/#rest-countries)
