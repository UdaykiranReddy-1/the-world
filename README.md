# the-world
 This is a simple React App that uses `restcountries API` to list all the countries of **The World** .

## Key Points :
+ It uses card-based display to show all countries with their flag , alongwith capital and population in the Home page .
+ When clicked on a specific country card , it directs to that specific country page , in which all details of the country can be presented.
+ Filters like filter by *Name* and *Continent* are available
+ *View on World Map* feature is added using leaflet (opensource map)

The Documentation for the used `restcountries API` can be [found here](https://restcountries.com/#rest-countries)
